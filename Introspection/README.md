## Introspection


#### Why should you choose me?
I am very intersted in coding since I started doing the same. I am willing to spent all my energy for the club and have the mind to do all the hardword that would be needed for it.


#### Changes before and after joining the collage

It is a very interesting campus with a lot of people and lot of groups with much varying interests. Hard time figuring out to which I belong!!!. In short, It's great.
Gained more confidence to learn new stuff and code
